# Kalman Filtering for Pairs Trading - WEEK2

### Step 1: Import Datasets

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following four datasets available and imported into your workspace:

1. **Dataset 1**: `stock_data_1.csv`
2. **Dataset 2**: `stock_data_2.csv`
3. **Dataset 3**: `spread_data.csv`
4. **Dataset 4**: `market_data.csv`

You can upload these datasets into your workspace and load them using Python libraries like Pandas.

### Step 2: Run the Code

After importing the datasets into your workspace, you can run the **Kalman_Filter_Techniques_And_Statistical_Arbitrage_In_China's_Futures_Market_In_Python.ipynb** notebook. The code will walk you through applying Kalman filtering for pairs trading and statistical arbitrage.

### Step 3: Use the "Pairs_Trading_week2.pdf"

To help with your understanding of the code and the overall concept of pairs trading, use the **Pairs_Trading_week2.pdf** alongside the notebook. The PDF contains detailed explanations of the theory and methodology used in pairs trading and Kalman filtering, and it will guide you step-by-step to understand the implementation in the code.

### Step 4: Understand the Code and Results

Once you run the code, it will apply the Kalman filter to the provided datasets and execute the pairs trading strategy. The results, including the trading signals and portfolio performance, will be outputted for your analysis. Review the output and compare it with the theoretical explanations in the PDF.
