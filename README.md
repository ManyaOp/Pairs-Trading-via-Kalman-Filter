# Pairs Trading with Kalman Filter

This project explores pairs trading using a dynamic, real-time hedge adjustment technique via the Kalman Filter. Created for WiDS (Winter in Data Science), IIT Bombay, 2024-25, this project aims to help students understand and implement pairs trading, an essential quantitative trading strategy, using Bayesian online training. This project is mentored by Nimay Shah and Devavrat Patni.

## 1. Introduction
Pairs trading is a market-neutral strategy in finance that capitalizes on the mean-reverting behavior of two correlated assets. When the relationship between two stocks diverges, traders can take a long-short position, betting that the two will realign. This project employs the Kalman Filter to adjust the hedge ratio dynamically, allowing for real-time trading strategy adjustments.

## 2. Background
The Kalman Filter is a recursive algorithm used for estimating variables of interest in real-time. In the context of pairs trading, the Kalman Filter provides an adaptive way to calculate the hedge ratio between two stocks. Instead of assuming a static relationship, the filter continuously updates this relationship as new data arrives, making it a robust tool for strategies that rely on changing market conditions.

## 3. Project Objectives
This project focuses on the following key objectives:
- **Understanding Pairs Trading:** Explore the theory and practice of pairs trading as a quantitative trading strategy.
- **Implementing the Kalman Filter:** Set up and implement the Kalman Filter to dynamically track and adjust hedge ratios.
- **Simulating Real-World Trading:** Apply the model to real-life stock data and simulate trades to evaluate strategy performance.
- **Avoiding Look-Ahead Bias:** Through the Bayesian nature of the Kalman Filter, ensure that the model avoids look-ahead bias and is suitable for backtesting.

## 4. Implementation Overview
The project consists of the following steps:
1. **Data Collection:** Collect historical data for two highly correlated stocks.
2. **Kalman Filter Setup:** Configure the Kalman Filter using the PyKalman library, initializing it with Bayesian parameters suitable for tracking stock relationships.
3. **Real-Time Adjustment of Hedge Ratio:** Use the Kalman Filter to dynamically update the hedge ratio, ensuring the pairs trading strategy remains responsive to market changes.
4. **Backtesting the Strategy:** Simulate historical pairs trading to assess the model’s effectiveness.
5. **Results Analysis:** Visualize and analyze results to see how well the Kalman Filter improves the trading strategy.

## 5. Requirements
To run this project, you’ll need the following:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **PyKalman:** For Kalman Filter implementation
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation
- **Matplotlib/Plotly:** For data visualization
- **Yahoo Finance API or yfinance library:** For obtaining stock data

You can install the required packages with:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib pykalman yfinance
```

## 6. Getting Started
- **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Pairs-Trading-via-Kalman-Filter.git
   cd kalman-pairs-trading
   ```
- **Set Up Your Environment:** Ensure that all the required libraries are installed.
- **Run the Data Collection Script:** Use the script to gather historical stock data for a pair of stocks (e.g., AAPL and MSFT).
- **Run the Kalman Filter Model:** Follow the notebook instructions to initialize the Kalman Filter and apply it to the collected data.

## 7. Code and Explanation
The code will include the following sections:
- **Data Collection:** : Uses yfinance to pull historical data on two correlated stocks, formatting it for the Kalman Filter.
- **Kalman Filter Model:** : The model initializes with parameters suited for financial time series, setting the observation matrix and covariance to track the hedge ratio.
- **Backtesting Strategy:** : Simulates historical pairs trades by triggering buy/sell actions when the price deviates from the calculated hedge ratio beyond a predefined threshold.
- **Visualization:** : Visualizes stock prices, hedge ratio changes, and trade signals, providing insights into model performance.

## 8. Conclusion
Through this project, we've created a pairs trading model that adapts to real-time data, helping to make trading strategies more responsive and market-aware. The Kalman Filter has proven effective at tracking hedge ratios, making this approach viable for real-world trading applications.
