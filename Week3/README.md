# Kalman Filtering for Pairs Trading - WEEK 3

In this week, we focus on some essential aspects of finance that are useful in all trading strategies, including **Risk Management** and **Volatility Thresholds**. Understanding and implementing these concepts can significantly improve the robustness and performance of trading systems, especially in pairs trading strategies.

The main material for this week includes:

1. **`risk_management_pairs_trading.ipynb`**: This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the implementation of various risk management techniques such as stop-loss orders, position sizing, and volatility-based thresholds within a pairs trading strategy using Kalman Filtering.
   
2. **Supporting Material**: For deeper insights into the financial concepts used in the notebook, a **PDF file** titled `Supporting_Material_For_Week3.pdf` has been provided, explaining the theoretical background and practical applications of risk management and volatility techniques.

## Recommended Resources:

To enhance your understanding of the key concepts covered in this week, the following resources are recommended:

1. **[Risk Management](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/09/risk-management.asp)**: A comprehensive article on the basics of risk management strategies in trading.
2. **[Volatility - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp)**: Learn about the concept of volatility and how it affects financial markets.
3. **[Embarcadero: Advanced Risk Management](https://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/PDF/Embarcadero.pdf)**: An advanced resource on risk management and its applications in quantitative finance.
4. **[Variance Threshold for Feature Selection](https://medium.com/aimonks/a-comprehensive-guide-to-feature-selection-using-variance-threshold-in-scikit-learn-0b10146aa71f)**: An article discussing the variance threshold for feature selection, which is also applicable in trading algorithms.
5. **[Strategies for Trading Volatility - Options Trading](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/021716/strategies-trading-volatility-options-nflx.asp)**: A guide on using volatility in options trading strategies.

## Additional Reading:

For those interested in diving deeper into Kalman Filters and their advanced applications, the following resources are recommended:

1. **[Adaptive Kalman Filters](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python/blob/master/14-Adaptive-Filtering.ipynb)**: A detailed notebook on adaptive Kalman Filters, useful in scenarios where the process noise changes over time.
2. **[Ensemble Kalman Filters](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python/blob/master/Appendix-E-Ensemble-Kalman-Filters.ipynb)**: Learn about the Ensemble Kalman Filter, an extension to the standard Kalman Filter that is particularly useful for high-dimensional systems.
3. **[Multivariate Kalman Filters](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python/blob/master/06-Multivariate-Kalman-Filters.ipynb)**: A guide to implementing Multivariate Kalman Filters, useful when working with systems with multiple variables.

## Assignment:

After reviewing the materials and exploring the concepts of risk management and volatility thresholds in the provided notebook, you can attempt the theoretical questions in the **Week 3 Assignment**. The questions will test your understanding of the key concepts discussed in this weekâ€™s content.
